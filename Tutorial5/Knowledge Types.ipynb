We will start by looking in more, practical detail at the sources WordNet, DBpedia & ConceptNet you heard about in the lecture.

Suddenly, she stumbled upon a clearing where sunlight cut through the trees, illuminating the vibrant colors of the wildflowers scattered around. Taking a moment to catch her breath, Sarah realized she needed to cut her losses and find another path. Her initial plan had been cut short by the unforgiving terrain. With determination, she adjusted her course, ready to cut across the forest in a new direction, hoping to reach her destination before nightfall.'"
